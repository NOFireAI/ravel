//! Per-signal background catalog fold task (docs/metric-index-plan.md
//! section 4, ADR-0020; storage-derived tenant set is ADR-0048 decision 3,
//! issue #504). Periodically calls [`Catalog::fold`] so query resolve can
//! serve sealed history from snapshots instead of full listing.
//!
//! Never runs on the ingest or query path, and never affects correctness:
//! every failure here is logged and retried on the next tick. Disabling this
//! task (`--disable-fold`) only changes query cost, never query results.
//!
//! One loop per [`FOLD_SIGNALS`] entry, not one per tenant: each tick
//! re-enumerates tenants from storage
//! ([`crate::tenant_discovery::discover_and_restrict_by_lifecycle`]) and folds
//! every tenant the cycle discovers, narrowed by each tenant's durable
//! lifecycle state and the flag fallback (ADR-0066 decision 6: a config record
//! keeps a tenant in the set unconditionally regardless of its token, and no
//! flag can exclude a config-recorded tenant). A tenant onboarded mid-run is
//! folded starting the next tick with no restart.
//! A discovery failure skips that signal's whole cycle -- no tenant is folded
//! -- and is retried next tick; it never falls back to an empty set, since
//! fold is best-effort and a quiet failure here would look identical to
//! "nothing new to fold."
